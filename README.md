# iOSChallengeASOS

**Space X** is a mobile aplication for iOS inspired by *Space X*. The app works on iOS11+ devices and supports both iPhone and iPad portrait and landscape designs.

SpaceX allows the user to see the company information and all the launch details. It also provides the capability to sort by ascending and descending order, and to filter by year and by launch success.

The app is coded using Swift 5 following a clean code architecture using VIPER. The project workspace implements each module added as an individual project for improved scalability potential.

The app uses the V4 API as V3 is deprecated.
